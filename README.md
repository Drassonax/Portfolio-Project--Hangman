Hangman App allows the user to play a game of Hangman. The app will fetch an expression from a remote source and show the user the number of words in the expression and the number of letters in each word. On each keypress the user makes, the app will evaluate whether the expression includes that character or not. If it does, that character will appear in all the correct places in the expression. Otherwise, the app will notify the user accordingly and reduce the number of remaining guesses left. If the user is left without any remaining guesses, a message notifying the user that he or she has lost the game along with the final answer will appear on the screen. In case the user guesses all the letters, a congratulatory message will appear notifying the user that he or she has won the game. At any time, the user can press the reset button which will fetch a new expression and the game will begin anew.
